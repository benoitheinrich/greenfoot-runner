# Description

This project is an attempt to provide a wrapper around the excellent [greenfoot](www.greenfoot.org) platform.

The goal is to allow developers to use external IDEs like IntelliJ to develop games.

This project doesn't provide as many features as the original greenfoot IDE, but is a nice transition from greenfoot to 
a professional IDE.

# Disclamer

This project isn't supported by any greenfoot team's member and is a personal attempt to allow my son to use IntelliJ 
IDEA to make his learning easier.
